🌸 Flower Prediction - ML-Powered Species Classification 🌿
This project is a machine learning-based flower classification system that predicts the species of a flower based on input features like petal length, sepal width, etc. It is built using Random Forest Classifier and deployed as a web application using Flask.

🚀 Project Overview
🔹 Uses the Iris dataset for training a Random Forest Classifier.
🔹 Implements Flask for a lightweight and interactive web UI.
🔹 Accepts user input through a web form and provides real-time predictions.
🔹 Model is serialized using Pickle for easy deployment.

✨ Features
✅ Machine Learning Model – Predicts flower species with high accuracy.
✅ Flask Web Interface – Simple UI for input and result display.
✅ Data Preprocessing – Standardizes input using StandardScaler().
✅ Real-Time Predictions – Instant classification of flowers.

🛠 Tech Stack
